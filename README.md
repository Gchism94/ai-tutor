# 🧠 AI Tutor (DEVELOPMENTAL soon to be CortexAI)

An open-source AI-powered tutor built to support student learning through adaptive quizzes, coding help, and ethical guidance.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This is an active developmental version of the AI Teaching Assistant.  
> The system is not yet production-ready and may undergo significant changes. 
>The current version is in the process of being consolidated into [jupyterquest](https://github.com/Gchism94/jupyterquest).  
> Contributions, feedback, and testing are welcome!

**CortexAI+** is designed to be embedded in data science courses as a virtual TA. It uses large language models (LLMs) to answer coding questions, generate personalized quizzes, and flag ethically sensitive responses—all while helping instructors keep tabs on student engagement and integrity.
